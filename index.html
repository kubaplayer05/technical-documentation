            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                    navigation. </li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                    on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
                    perform file manipulations on a server. </li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="What_you_should_already_know">
            <header>What you should already know</header>
            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
                </li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the
                    main page about JavaScript. </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
            <header>Hello world</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
                code: </p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");</code>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser! </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
                With the keyword var or const. For example,
            </p>
            <code>var x = 42</code>
            <code>const x = 42</code>
            <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
            <code>x = 42.</code>
            <p> This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                variant.

                With the keyword let. For example, </p>
            <code>let y = 13.</code>
            <p> This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
            <header>Data types</header>
            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is
                            not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant. </li>
                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined. </li>
                        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>and Object</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with
                your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
                think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can
                perform. </p>
